For best performance, the function evaluating the constraint Jacobian typically only evaluates the nonzero elements. To make things simple, we treat the Jacobian as dense. \n",

    "We've encapsulated all of the problem information into a `struct` for convenience (and to avoid polluting our global workspace with uncessary global variables). \n",

    "All of the methods you need to implement in this problem are in external Julia files.\n",
    "Feel free to use a text editor / IDE of your choice (the Julia VSCode extension is the IDE recommended by the Julia community) to write and test these methods. You can use the `q2.jl` script to run the code, which includes tests that are identical to those in this notebook. We will be running the notebooks for for the autograder, so before you submit make sure this notebook runs as expected and passes the tests (or run `test/runtests.jl` which will run the autograder)."

    "# Part (e): EXTRA CREDIT Leveraging sparsity (max 5 pts)\n",
    "NLP solvers like Ipopt or SNOPT are designed to leverage sparsity in the problem, especially in the constraint Jacobian. Right now we're ignoring the sparsity structure in the constraint Jacobian, so the solver iterations are fairly slow. Get up to 5 extra credit points by leveraging the sparsity structure in the constraint Jacobian. You'll need to read up on how to specify the sparsity pattern in the [MathOptInterface.jl documentation](http://jump.dev/MathOptInterface.jl/stable/reference/nonlinear/). You should only leverage the sparsity when the `use_sparse_jacobian` flag in the `NLP` struct is set to true. We use this flag to compare the solutions between the normal (dense) version and your sparse version. You'll get points for having matching Jacobians, the size of the nonzeros vector you're passing to Ipopt (shoot for a sparsity of less than 2-5%). You'll also get up to 2 points for the speedup you get from the solver (the TA solution got a speed up of about 100x).\n",
